# go-whosonfirst-pip

Expermimental in-memory point-in-polygon (reverse geocoding) library for Who's On First data

## Set up

### Setting up your Go path

```
export GOPATH=`pwd`
```

_Adjust accordingly if you are using a shell other than Bash._

### Dependencies

```
go get -u "github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-geojson"
go get -u "github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-utils"
go get -u "github.com/kellydunn/golang-geo"
go get -u "github.com/dhconnelly/rtreego"
```

There is also a helpful `deps` target in the included Makefile to do this for you.

### Mirror mirror on the wall

```
if test -d pkg; then rm -rf pkg; fi
if test -d src/github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-pip; then rm -rf src/github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-pip; fi
mkdir -p src/github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-pip
cp *.go src/github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-pip/
```

I am still a bit lost and baffled by how and where Go thinks to look for stuff. In order to make standalone tools compile locally I just clone any package specific code in to the `src` directory. It's not pretty but it works.

There is also a helpful `self` target in the included Makefile to do this for you.

### Tools

```
go build -o bin/index bin/index.go
go build -o bin/index-csv bin/index-csv.go
go build -o bin/pip-server bin/pip-server.go
```

There is also a helpful `bin` target in the included Makefile to do this for you.

## Usage

### The basics

```
package main

import (
	"github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-pip"
)

source := "/usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data"
p := pip.PointInPolygon(source)

geojson_file := "/usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/data/101/736/545/101736545.geojson"
p.IndexGeoJSONFile(geojson_file)

# Or this:

meta_file := "/usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/meta/wof-locality-latest.csv"
p.IndexMetaFile(meta_file)
```

You can index individual GeoJSON files or [Who's On First "meta" files](https://github.com/whosonfirst/whosonfirst-data/tree/master/meta) which are just CSV files with pointers to individual Who's On First records.

The `PointInPolygon` function takes as its sole argument the root path where your Who's On First documents are stored. This is because those files are used to perform a final "containment" check. The details of this are discussed further below.

### Simple

```

lat := 40.677524
lon := -73.987343

results, timings := p.GetByLatLon(lat, lon)

for i, f := range results {
	fmt.Printf("simple result #%d is %s\n", i, f.Name)
}

for _, t := range timings {
        fmt.Printf("[timing] %s: %f\n", t.Event, t.Duration)
}
```

`results` contains a list of `geojson.WOFSpatial` object-interface-struct-things and `timings` contains a list of `pip.WOFPointInPolygonTiming` object-interface-struct-things. 

### What's going on under the hood

```
results := p.GetIntersectsByLatLon(lat, lon)

for i, r := range results {
	fmt.Printf("spatial result #%d is %v\n", i, r)
}

inflated := p.InflateSpatialResults(results)

for i, wof := range inflated {
	fmt.Printf("wof result #%d is %s\n", i, wof.Name)
}

# This only happens when you call `GetByLatLonForPlacetype`

filtered := p.FilterByPlacetype(inflated, "locality")

for i, f := range filtered {
	fmt.Printf("filtered result #%d is %s\n", i, f.Name)
}

contained := p.EnsureContained(lat, lon, inflated)

for i, f := range contained {
	fmt.Printf("contained result #%d is %s\n", i, f.Name)
}

```

If you're curious how the sausage is made.

### HTTP Ponies

There is also a standalone HTTP server for performing point-in-polygon lookups. It is instantiated with a `source` parameter and one or more "meta" CSV files, like this:

```
$> ./bin/pip-server -source /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/data /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/meta/wof-neighbourhood-latest.csv
indexed 49906 records in 47.895 seconds
```

This is how you'd use it:

```
$> curl 'http://localhost:8080?latitude=40.677524&longitude=-73.987343' | python -mjson.tool
[
    {
        "Id": 102061079,
        "Name": "Gowanus Heights",
        "Placetype": "neighbourhood"
    },
    {
        "Id": 85865587,
        "Name": "Gowanus",
        "Placetype": "neighbourhood"
    }
]
```

## Assumptions, caveats and known-knowns

### When we say `geojson` in the context of Go-typing

We are talking about the [go-whosonfirst-geojson](https://www.github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-geojson) library.

### Speed and performance

This is how it works now:

1. We are using the [rtreego](https://www.github.com/dhconnelly/rtreego) library to do most of the heavy lifting and filtering.
2. Results from the rtreego `SearchIntersect` method are "inflated" and recast as geojson `WOFSpatial` object-interface-struct-things.
3. We are performing a final containment check on the results by reading each corresponding GeoJSON file and converting its geometry in to one or more [golang-geo](https://www.github.com/kellydunn/golang-geo) `Polygon` object-interface-struct-things. Each of these object-interface-struct-things calls its `Contains` method on an input coordinate.

This is how long it takes reverse-geocoding a point in Brooklyn, using an index of all the countries in Who's On First:

```
[timings] 40.677524,-73.987343 ()
[timing] intersects: 0.000030
[timing] inflate: 0.000000
[timing] contained: 0.115600
```

If we break that down a bit more we can see that most of the time is spent reading/parsing (does it matter?) the GeoJSON files from disk:

```
./bin/pip-server -source /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/data /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/meta/wof-neighbourhood-latest.csv /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/meta/wof-country-latest.csv 
indexed 50124 records in 60.472 seconds 
time to unmarshal /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/data/102/061/079/102061079.geojson is 0.000108
time to convert geom to polygons is 0.000009
time to check containment (true) after 1/1 possible iterations is 0.000002
time to unmarshal /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/data/856/337/93/85633793.geojson is 0.103965
time to convert geom to polygons is 0.010570
time to check containment (true) after 75/75 possible iterations is 0.000935
time to unmarshal /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/data/858/655/87/85865587.geojson is 0.000300
time to convert geom to polygons is 0.000044
time to check containment (true) after 2/2 possible iterations is 0.000002
time to unmarshal /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/data/858/406/09/85840609.geojson is 0.000248
time to convert geom to polygons is 0.000017
time to check containment (false) after 1/1 possible iterations is 0.000001
contained: 3/4
[timings] 40.677524, -73.987343 (3 results)
[timing] intersects: 0.000236
[timing] inflate: 0.000001
[timing] contained: 0.116374
```

So, that's a known-known. On the other hand unless you're doing a lot of reverse-geocoding around convergent international borders it's probably not going to be that big a deal. For example:

```
$> siege -c 100 -i -f urls2.txt 
** SIEGE 3.0.5
** Preparing 100 concurrent users for battle.
The server is now under siege...^C
Lifting the server siege...      done.

```

Or maybe files with (n) number of polygons / coordinates could be cached in memory. Or something. Whatever the case there is room for making this "Moar Faster".

_If you're wondering, sorting the polygons by largest number of coordinates before iterating over them doesn't appear to have any meaningful performance improvement._

### Using this with other data sources

Yeah... _probably_. Not? _Yet._

There's nothing in this library per se that would prevent you from using it with any old bag of GeoJSON. It's more that this library uses [go-whosonfirst-geojson](https://www.github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-geojson) which _does_ make some WOF-specific assumptions.

Specifically, in the `EnSpatialize` method which is used to generate a `rtreego.Spatial` compatible interface, like this:

```
func (wof WOFFeature) EnSpatialize() (*WOFSpatial, error) {

     // These all look for things prefixed by "wof:" in the properties hash

     id := wof.WOFId()
     name := wof.WOFName()
     placetype := wof.WOFPlacetype()
```

So that should be changed, or made WOF-specific. Or something. Because yes, you ought to be able to use this (and the `go-whosonfirst-geojson`) library with any old GeoJSON file out there. But not today.
