# go-whosonfirst-pip

Expermimental in-memory point-in-polygon (reverse geocoding) library for Who's On First data

## Set up

### Setting up your Go path

```
export GOPATH=`pwd`
```

_Adjust accordingly if you are using a shell other than Bash._

### Dependencies

```
go get -u "github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-geojson"
go get -u "github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-utils"
go get -u "github.com/kellydunn/golang-geo"
go get -u "github.com/dhconnelly/rtreego"
```

There is also a helpful `deps` target in the included Makefile to do this for you.

### Mirror mirror on the wall

```
if test -d pkg; then rm -rf pkg; fi
if test -d src/github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-pip; then rm -rf src/github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-pip; fi
mkdir -p src/github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-pip
cp *.go src/github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-pip/
```

I am still a bit lost and baffled by how and where Go thinks to look for stuff. In order to make standalone tools compile locally I just clone any package specific code in to the `src` directory. It's not pretty but it works.

There is also a helpful `self` target in the included Makefile to do this for you.

### Tools

```
go build -o bin/index bin/index.go
go build -o bin/index-csv bin/index-csv.go
go build -o bin/pip-server bin/pip-server.go
```

There is also a helpful `bin` target in the included Makefile to do this for you.

## Usage

### The basics

```
package main

import (
	"github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-pip"
)

source := "/usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data"
p := pip.PointInPolygon(source)

geojson_file := "/usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/data/101/736/545/101736545.geojson"
p.IndexGeoJSONFile(geojson_file)

# Or this:

meta_file := "/usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/meta/wof-locality-latest.csv"
p.IndexMetaFile(meta_file)
```

You can index individual GeoJSON files or [Who's On First "meta" files](https://github.com/whosonfirst/whosonfirst-data/tree/master/meta) which are just CSV files with pointers to individual Who's On First records.

The `PointInPolygon` function takes as its sole argument the root path where your Who's On First documents are stored. This is because those files are used to perform a final "containment" check. The details of this are discussed further below.

### Simple

```

lat := 40.677524
lon := -73.987343

results, timings := p.GetByLatLon(lat, lon)

for i, f := range results {
	fmt.Printf("simple result #%d is %s\n", i, f.Name)
}

for _, t := range timings {
        fmt.Printf("[timing] %s: %f\n", t.Event, t.Duration)
}
```

`results` contains a list of `geojson.WOFSpatial` object-interface-struct-things and `timings` contains a list of `pip.WOFPointInPolygonTiming` object-interface-struct-things. 

### What's going on under the hood

```
results := p.GetIntersectsByLatLon(lat, lon)

for i, r := range results {
	fmt.Printf("spatial result #%d is %v\n", i, r)
}

inflated := p.InflateSpatialResults(results)

for i, wof := range inflated {
	fmt.Printf("wof result #%d is %s\n", i, wof.Name)
}

# This only happens when you call `GetByLatLonForPlacetype`

filtered := p.FilterByPlacetype(inflated, "locality")

for i, f := range filtered {
	fmt.Printf("filtered result #%d is %s\n", i, f.Name)
}

contained := p.EnsureContained(lat, lon, inflated)

for i, f := range contained {
	fmt.Printf("contained result #%d is %s\n", i, f.Name)
}

```

If you're curious how the sausage is made.

### HTTP Ponies

There is also a standalone HTTP server for performing point-in-polygon lookups. It is instantiated with a `source` parameter and one or more "meta" CSV files, like this:

```
$> ./bin/pip-server -source /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/data /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/meta/wof-neighbourhood-latest.csv
indexed 49906 records in 47.895 seconds
```

This is how you'd use it:

```
$> curl 'http://localhost:8080?latitude=40.677524&longitude=-73.987343' | python -mjson.tool
[
    {
        "Id": 102061079,
        "Name": "Gowanus Heights",
        "Placetype": "neighbourhood"
    },
    {
        "Id": 85865587,
        "Name": "Gowanus",
        "Placetype": "neighbourhood"
    }
]
```

## Assumptions, caveats and known-knowns

### When we say `geojson` in the context of Go-typing

We are talking about the [go-whosonfirst-geojson](https://www.github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-geojson) library.

### Speed and performance

This is how it works now:

1. We are using the [rtreego](https://www.github.com/dhconnelly/rtreego) library to do most of the heavy lifting and filtering.
2. Results from the rtreego `SearchIntersect` method are "inflated" and recast as geojson `WOFSpatial` object-interface-struct-things.
3. We are performing a final containment check on the results by reading each corresponding GeoJSON file and converting its geometry in to one or more [golang-geo](https://www.github.com/kellydunn/golang-geo) `Polygon` object-interface-struct-things. Each of these object-interface-struct-things calls its `Contains` method on an input coordinate.

This is how long it takes reverse-geocoding a point in Brooklyn, using an index of all the countries in Who's On First:

```
[timings] 40.677524,-73.987343 ()
[timing] intersects: 0.000030
[timing] inflate: 0.000000
[timing] contained: 0.115600
```

If we break that down a bit more we can see that most of the time is spent reading/parsing (does it matter?) the GeoJSON files from disk:

```
./bin/pip-server -source /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/data /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/meta/wof-neighbourhood-latest.csv /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/meta/wof-country-latest.csv

[timing] contained: 0.116374
```

So, that's a known-known. On the other hand unless you're doing a lot of reverse-geocoding around convergent international borders it's probably not going to be that big a deal. For example:

```
$> siege -c 100 -i -f urls2.txt 
** SIEGE 3.0.5
** Preparing 100 concurrent users for battle.
The server is now under siege...^C
Lifting the server siege...      done.

But yeah, countries are a thing. Reverse geocoding a point in Montr√©al to country level looks like this:

```
time to unmarshal /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/data/856/330/41/85633041.geojson is 0.074364
time to convert geom to polygons is 0.007616
time to check containment (true) after 10/382 possible iterations is 0.000005

time to check containment (false) after 4800/4800 possible iterations is 0.005303
time to unmarshal /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/data/856/337/93/85633793.geojson is 0.106507
time to convert geom to polygons is 0.009863
time to check containment (false) after 75/75 possible iterations is 0.000949
contained: 1/3
[timings] 45.572744, -73.586295 (1 results)
[timing] intersects: 0.000030
[timing] inflate: 0.000001
[timing] contained: 1.317275
```

And of course if you're trying to do anything in [New Zealand](https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/spelunker/id/85633345/) you should get a cup of coffee:

```
time to unmarshal /usr/local/mapzen/whosonfirst-data/data/856/333/45/85633345.geojson is 5.302032
time to convert geom to polygons is 0.827670
time to check containment (true) after 3538/5825 possible iterations is 0.027860
contained: 1/1
[timings] -43.587711, 170.366638 (1 results)
[timing] intersects: 0.000021
[timing] inflate: 0.000000
[timing] contained: 6.157659
```

Keep in mind New Zealand is a known extreme case and it's "ground truth" polygon is probably not what you need for reverse geocoding. There is a separate on-going process for [sorting out geometries in Who's On First](https://github.com/whosonfirst/whosonfirst-geometries) but on-going work is on-going.

So maybe files with (n) number of polygons / coordinates could be cached in memory (see below). Or something. Whatever the case there is room for making this "Moar Faster".

_If you're wondering, sorting the polygons by largest number of coordinates before iterating over them doesn't appear to have any meaningful performance improvement._

### Yes, you can totally DOS yourself by loading Who's On First countries

See above. It takes about two and a half minutes and two hundred concurrent requests to overwhelm a machine with 32GB RAM. So that's not awesome. Again, some sort of caching mechanismlike Google's [groupcache](https://github.com/golang/groupcache ) or really anything to prevent everyone from opening (and parsing) the same too-too large GeoJSON files over and over and over again.

### Using this with other data sources

Yeah... _probably_. Not? _Yet._

There's nothing in this library per se that would prevent you from using it with any old bag of GeoJSON. It's more that this library uses [go-whosonfirst-geojson](https://www.github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-geojson) which _does_ make some WOF-specific assumptions.

Specifically, in the `EnSpatialize` method which is used to generate a `rtreego.Spatial` compatible interface, like this:

```
func (wof WOFFeature) EnSpatialize() (*WOFSpatial, error) {

     // These all look for things prefixed by "wof:" in the properties hash

     id := wof.WOFId()
     name := wof.WOFName()
     placetype := wof.WOFPlacetype()
```

So that should be changed, or made WOF-specific. Or something. Because yes, you ought to be able to use this (and the `go-whosonfirst-geojson`) library with any old GeoJSON file out there. But not today.

### Less-than-perfect GeoJSON files

First, these should not be confused with malformed GeoJSON files. Some records in Who's On First are missing geometries or maybe the geometries are... well, less than perfect. The `rtreego` package is very strict about what it can handle and freaks out and dies rather than returning errors. So that's still a thing. Personally I like the idea of using `pip-server` as a kind of unfriendly validation tool for Who's On First data but it also means that, for the time being, it is understood that some records may break everything.
